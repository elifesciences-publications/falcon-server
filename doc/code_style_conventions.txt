Falcon developers agree on the following code style rules.


**RULE 1: Definitons in Headers**
Source code that is not part of a template or of an inline function must be located in a *.cpp file. The rule applies for simple getter and setter methods/functions as well. Expetion is made for empty defintions ({}).
As a consequence of this rule, all default values should appear only in the declaration (header).
As regards templates, you are encouraged to put the definition in a dedicated *.ipp file in order to improve the readibility of the header.


**RULE 2: Style for method and function definition**
Methods and functions must follow the following convention: first bracket on the first line separated by a white space, and the 2nd line is always an empty one. Moreover the body of the definition must be indented with four spaces. Example:

return_type function( type data ) {

        do_something();
}

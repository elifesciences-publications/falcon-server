Each Digital Lynx SX data record consists of a single A/D sample from every channel and is organized in 3 sections as below:

1. Header [68 Bytes] consists of 17 32-bit values
1.1. Start of frame (fixed value)
1.2. Packet ID (fixed value)
1.3. Record Size (fixed value)
1.4. Timestamp high order bytes (high order 32 bits of 64 bit TS)
1.5. Timestamp low order bytes (high order 32 bits of 64 bit TS)
1.6. System Status
1.7. TTL IO
1.8. Reserved 0
1.9. Reserved 1
1.10. Reserved 2
1.11. Reserved 3
1.12. Reserved 4
1.13. Reserved 5
1.14. Reserved 6
1.15. Reserved 7
1.16. Reserved 8
1.17. Reserved 9
2. Data [128 bytes * number of input boards] each 32-channel input board generates a 32x32-bit array of values
3. Footer [4 bytes] A simple checksum, bitwise XOR of all prior 32-bit values in the record

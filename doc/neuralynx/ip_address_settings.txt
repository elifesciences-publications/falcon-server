In order to read data from Neuralynx a default IP address must be set on the network socket (192.168.3.100).

You can use the following command to set it. 

sudo ifconfig <ethx> 192.168.3.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

(Replace <ethx> with the interface of the network card used for reading UDP pakceges from the Neuralynx Digilynx.)
